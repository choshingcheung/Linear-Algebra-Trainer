      "question": "If A is an m × n matrix and A has n pivot positions then the columns of A span Rm.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "The columns of an m × n matrix A with n pivot positions will span R^m only if A is square (m = n) and invertible. If m > n, even with n pivot positions, the columns of A can only span a subspace of R^m."
  },
  {
      "question": "A 6 × 3 matrix has 6 columns.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "A 6 × 3 matrix means it has 6 rows and 3 columns, not 6 columns. The first number denotes the number of rows, and the second number denotes the number of columns."
  },
  {
      "question": "The equation Ax = b has a solution if the vector b is a linear combination of the columns of A.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "The equation Ax = b has a solution if and only if the vector b is within the column space of A, meaning it can be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of A."
  },
  {
      "question": "If an augmented matrix [ A | b ] can be transformed by elementary row operations into [ C | d ], then the equations Ax = b and Cx = d have exactly the same solution sets.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "Elementary row operations do not change the solution set of a linear system. Therefore, transforming [A | b] into [C | d] preserves the solution sets, making Ax = b and Cx = d equivalent."
  },
  {
      "question": "If S = span{0} then S is a set containing a single vector.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "The span of {0} consists only of the zero vector itself, indicating that S contains a single vector, which is the zero vector."
  },
  {
      "question": "If w is a linear combination of u and v in Rn, then u is a linear combination of v and w.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "The statement that w being a linear combination of u and v implies u is a linear combination of v and w does not necessarily hold, as linear combinations depend on the specific vectors and coefficients involved."
  },
  {
      "question": "A linear transformation T : Rn → Rm is completely determined by its effect on the columns of the n × n identity matrix.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "A linear transformation T from R^n to R^m is determined by its action on the basis vectors of R^n, typically represented by the columns of the identity matrix, implying it's fully defined by these effects."
  },
  {
      "question": "Not every linear transformation from Rn to Rm is a matrix transformation.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "Every linear transformation from R^n to R^m can be represented as a matrix transformation, meaning this transformation can be associated with a matrix A such that T(x) = Ax for all x in R^n."
  },
  {
      "question": "The co-domain of the transformation x → Ax is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of A.",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "The co-domain of a transformation x → Ax is indeed the set of all linear combinations of the columns of A, which is known as the column space of A."
  },
  {
      "question": "Given a linearly independent set of vectors {v1, v2, v3}, 0 ∈ span{v1, v2, v3}",
      "answer": true,
      "explanation": "The zero vector is always in the span of any set of vectors because a linear combination of vectors using all zero coefficients will yield the zero vector."
  },
  {
      "question": "A mapping T : Rn → Rm is onto Rm if every vector x ∈ Rn maps onto some vector in Rm.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "A mapping T from R^n to R^m is onto R^m if for every vector in R^m, there exists at least one vector in R^n that maps to it, which depends on T covering all of R^m."
  },
  {
      "question": "If a set contains fewer vectors than there are entries in the vectors, then the set is linearly independent.",
      "answer": false,
      "explanation": "Having fewer vectors than the number of entries in each vector does not automatically make a set linearly independent. Linear independence requires that no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others."
